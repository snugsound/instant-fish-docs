Customizing Fish
################

The appearance of fish is made up of two parts:

* A prefab, which dictates the structure of the fish (body shape, head shape, number of fins and fin locations)
* A profile, which dictates the textures, fins, and eyes

Upon dragging a prefab into the scene, have a look at the Fish component. You'll notice a ``Profile`` attribute. Here you can specify a different profile. If you wish to preview profiles in the editor, click the Refresh button. (Note: this will happen automatically when playing the scene.)

.. TIP::
   Several pre-defined profiles are available and can be mixed & matched with any prefab. For even more variation, a Random profile has been provided. This pulls from all available textures and fin types, creating new and interesting combinations.

.. TIP::
   You can see a variety of fish on display in the ``FishViewer`` demo scene.
